# Install Bootstrap and FontAwesome

use npm to install the dependencies:

npm install bootstrap font-awesome --save

dependencies are installed we can tell Angular CLI that it needs to load these styles

One easy way to do this is by opening the file src/styles.css and adding the following lines:

@import "~bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.css";

@import "~font-awesome/css/font-awesome.css";


First install jQuery using npm as follows

npm install jquery --save

Second go to the ./angular-cli.json file at the root of your Angular CLI project folder, and find the scripts: [] property, and include the path to jQuery as follows

"scripts": [ "../node_modules/jquery/dist/jquery.min.js" ]


Note: If you want to use bootstrap in your application or if you already have in your project, make sure to include jQuery before including the bootstrap javascript file as follows. Since bootstrapâ€™s javascript file requires jQuery.

"scripts": [ "../node_modules/jquery/dist/jquery.min.js",

"../node_modules/bootstrap/dist/js/bootstrap.js"]


Now to use jQuery, all you have to do is to import it as follows in whatever component you want to use jQuery.

import * as $ from 'jquery';
